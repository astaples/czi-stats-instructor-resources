Resources for instructors using Introduction to Statistics: A Modeling Approach

## Available resources

There are three categories of resources: Syllabi, Class Materials, and Assessments. 

Class materials range from worksheets, pdf slides, to powerpoint slides. 

Assessments range from paper and pencil tests to qualtrics files. If you do use the assessments here as a resource, we recommend that you use different data sets or contexts because these are publicly available (that is, students can also find the assessments that are posted here).

All resources are "cumulative" in that if something is labeled "ch5" that worksheet, slide deck, or assessment may include material from chapters 1 to 5. It is assumed that students will have completed up through chapter 5 before this resource. 

## Where are these resources from?
Several instructors contribute to these sample resources. A little information about who they are and the contexts in which they developed these are provided here. Their last names will be part of the file names.
