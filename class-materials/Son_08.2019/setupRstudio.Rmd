# Downloading and Installing Packages
You only have to do this once.

```{r}
# install multiple packages at once
install.packages(pkgs = c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "ggformula",
"mosaic", "supernova", "lsr","Lock5Data", "Lock5withR",
"okcupiddata", "dslabs","fivethirtyeight"))
```


# Loading Packages
You have to do this for every notebook or every session of R.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggformula)
library(mosaic)
library(supernova)
library(lsr)
library(Lock5withR)
library(okcupiddata)
library(dslabs)
library(fivethirtyeight)
```

```{r}
head(USStates)
```

```{r}
str(USStates)
```





Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

```{r}
gf_histogram(~ Thumb, data = Fingers, fill = "orange")
```

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.



When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
