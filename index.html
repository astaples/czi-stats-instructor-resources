  <h2>Some quick notes</h2>
  <p>
    Clicking the header to each of the categories below will display a list of the files in that category. All resources listed are "cumulative" in that if something is labeled "ch5", that worksheet, slide deck, or assessment may include material from chapters 1 through 5. It is assumed that students will have completed up through chapter 5 before they use this resource.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Important: students can also find the assessments that are posted here.</strong> If you use these assessments, we recommend that you use different data sets or contexts to implement them.
